There is a vector of data values for each pixel, for example the red, green, and blue color channels.  The data passes through a series of convolutional layers.  Each layer combines the data from a pixel and its neighbors to produce a new data vector for the pixel.  Early layers detect small scale local patterns, while later layers detect larger, more abstract patterns.  Often the convolutional layers alternate with pooling layers that perform some operation such as max or min over local regions.\n",

They begin with a data vector for each node of the graph (for example, the chemical properties of the atom that node represents).
